# TFM_EM
The latest advances in technologies such as NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) makes faster and cheaper the obtaintion of genetic data in molecular diagnostic laboratories. However, the clinical interpretation of the data obtained remains complex. The main objective of this TFM is the development of a bioinformatic tool for the analysis of genomic data which facilitates the work of researchers in the area of genetic diagnosis of RASopathies. Specifically, to develop an application to help classify variants detected from NGS in genes involved in the disease in a semi-automatic manner.

In this TFM it has been decided to work based on the guidelines for the classification of variants established by the group of experts ClinGen RASopathy (RAS EP).

As a result, an R-script has been obtained that allows the classification of variants of genes related to RASopathies and that generates a report with the result of the classification. And a web application designed with R/Shiny where the user can consult in a semi-automatic manner the classification of the variants of the genes related to the RASopaties.

Currently most laboratories use NGS panels to perform genetic testing for RASopathies, the difficulty in classifying variants can be solved in some way with the use of established guidelines. However, it remains a problem when it has to be done routinely, in these cases it is still necessary to design applications that allow the classification of these variants in a semi-automatic manner.
